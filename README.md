# TimeWaste
TimeWaste is an esoteric programming language.

It is based on Python3 and was created to ... well, waste your time.

Basically it is like standard Python3 but certain keywords can only be executed at certain times.

Timetable:
|  Keyword  |      Time     |
|-----------|---------------|
|   while   | 00:00 - 01:00 |
|    for    | 01:00 - 02:00 |
|   print   | 02:00 - 03:00 |
|   input   | 03:00 - 04:00 |
|     if    | 04:00 - 05:00 |
|   import  | 05:00 - 06:00 |
